            <p>Interest in using electroencephalography (EEG) to identify neural correlates of depression surfaced as early as four decades ago (Schiller, 2019). By the late 1980s, researchers were calling for the creation of EEG profiles to catalogue effects of different medications used to treat psychiatric disorders (Knott & Lapierre, 1987). Differences in patterns of brain activity were identified between people with untreated depression and people without depression. Additionally, specific changes in brain waves were found that correlated with antidepressant treatment (Knott & Lapierre, 1987).</p>

            <p>In addition to predictive value, EEG technology is useful for <b>identifying severity of depression</b>, a range that may be difficult to accurately determine simply through interviewing a patient in a clinical setting. A study on severity of depressive symptoms examined six different EEG indices across four EEG bands, and found that a reduction of symptoms correlated with decreased slow waves and increased fast waves (Knott, Mahoney Kennedy, & Evans, 2000). Additionally, it is of note that scores on a screening measure of depressive symptoms correlated with EEG results, suggestive of concurrent validity.   </p>

               <p>This process results in aggregating patients with opposite symptoms together, considering them as simply having the same disorder (Goldberg, 2011).</p>
               <p>A recent review of the literature on depression biomarkers found that all biomarkers are not equally salient in symptom detection. Connecting biomarkers with specific symptoms may prove especially useful in identifying patients who are at a higher risk for suicidality, which is of importance in managing risk (de Aguiar Neto & Garcia Rosa, 2019).</p>
               <p>A meta-analysis identified the gamma band, theta band, and signal complexity as most important for diagnosing depression (Bachmann et al., 2018; Fitzgerald & Watson, 2018; Hosseinifard et al., 2013; Mahato & Paul, 2019; Shen et al., 2017; as cited in de Aguiar Neto & Garcia Rosa, 2019).</p>
               <p>The alpha band offers increased diagnostic specificity such as differentiating major depression from bipolar disorder and identifying suicidal ideation, as well as aiding in the development of a prognosis (Dolsen et al., 2017; Nusslock et al., 2018; van der Vinne et al., 2017; as cited in de Aguiar Neto & Garcia Rosa, 2019).</p>

            <p>May also help in creating personalized treatment plans that are tailored to the needs of individual patients.</p>
            <p>A study on factors influencing physiciansâ€™ decision to prescribe antidepressants found that physicians are motivated to prescribe when symptoms are severe, but also by social factors such as therapy being inaccessible and the patientâ€™s attitude towards medication (Hyde et al., 2005).</p>
            <p>This kind of decision-making lacks precision and is not based on data regarding whether a particular patient would actually benefit from medication. In contrast, EEG demonstrated utility in predicting patient response to medication (SSRIs or an SNRI) with approximately 60% accuracy.</p>
            <p>An index combining EEG measurements at different points in time was slightly more accurate, at 70% (Iosifescu et al., 2009). A similar study with an SSRI found that EEG analysis yielded over 82% predictive accuracy (Zhdanov et al., 2020).</p>

            <p>These results are important in demonstrating the wide range of utility EEG technology contributes to detection and treatment of depression. In summary, in addition to providing biomarkers to identify someone who is currently depressed, EEGs may assist in predicting a personâ€™s future emotional state and potential improvement in response to treatment, as well as monitoring change in symptoms.</p>
