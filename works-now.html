         <p>The mental health condition commonly referred to as “depression,” is typically and abrreviation for major
            depressive disorder, although other unipolar depressive disorders also exist. The current edition of the
            Diagnostic and Statistical Handbook of <b>Mental Disorders (DSM-5)</b> requires that at least five out of
            nine symptoms including depressed mood or loss of interest/pleasure must be present every day for a minimum
            of two weeks (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Other possible symptoms include weight changes,
            increase in purposeless movement or slowed movement, decreased energy or fatigue, feelings of worthlessness
            or guilt, impairment in cognitive functions such as concentration and decision-making, and suicidal ideation
            Association, 2013). The DSM-5 also includes seven severity/</p>
         <p>course descriptors for greater diagnostic specificity (American Psychiatricd Association, 2013). Two
            descriptors indicate degree of recovery (if any), three are severity indicators, one notes if psychotic
            features accompany depressive symptoms, and the last is denotes unspecified depression. Each of these
            descriptors is assigned a unique diagnostic code. Nine additional specifiers paint a more detailed picture
            about a particular patient’s illness, such as whether the depression has a seasonal pattern, occurred after
            childbirth, or is accompanied by catatonia, anxiety, or manic symptoms. There is no limit to the number of
            latter specifiers that can be applied to a major depression diagnosis (American Psychiatric Association,
            2013). </p>

               <h2>The Beck Depression Inventory-II <span>BDI-II</span></h2>
               <p>is one commonly used self-report measure</p>
            </div>
            <p>Comprised of 21 items, it measures symptoms of depression for the most recent two-week period and is intended for use in both normal and psychiatric populations (Smarr & Keefer, 2011). <span class="dark">Each item is rated for severity on a scale of 0-3, zero indicating the absence of the symptom and three indicating extreme severity.</span> The recommended ranges for interpreting overall scores are <span class="red">0-13</span> (minimal depression), <span class="red">14-19</span> (mild depression), <span class="red">20-28</span> (moderate depression), and <span class="red">29-63</span> (severe depression). Determining sensitivity and specificity for this measure is a bit challenging, as different cutoff scores are recommended for different groups of patients (e.g., those with different comorbid medical diagnoses) to achieve optimal levels of accuracy. Therefore, these score ranges may not be all-encompassing in their applicability to various populations (Smarr & Keefer, 2011). However, in general, a review of the literature reported <span class="dark">sensitivity at approximately 70%</span> (Wang & Gorenstein, 2013) In addition to the absence of a universally applicable cutoff score, other limitations of the BDI-II include problems with establishing the validity of this measure across cultures. While the BDI-II has been translated into several different languages, insufficient evidence exists to fully support cross-cultural comparability (Wang & Gorenstein, 2013).</p>

            <p>It is a 9-item scale that also provides item <span class="dark">scores ranging from 0-3.</span> However, unlike the BDI-II , these subscores indicate frequency of symptoms—not at all to nearly every day (Kroenke et al., 2001). When compared to scores on a structured interview, <span class="dark">sensitivity was 74% and specificity was 91% with a cutoff score of 10</span> (Huba et al., 2014). which is a higher score than originally recommended by the test developer (Spitzer et al., 1999; as cited in Huba et al., 2014). Huba and colleagues also found that 25% of patients who met criteria for a depression diagnosis through the PHQ-9 did not qualify for this diagnosis when assessed with the BDI, an earlier version of the BDI-II. Similarly, another study comparing PHQ-9 and BDI-II scores found a <span class="dark">77% correlation between overall scores</span> (Kung et al., 2013).</p>
